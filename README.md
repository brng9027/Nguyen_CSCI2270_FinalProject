CSCI2270 Final Project

This program is just an extension of Assignment 7. It uses both trees and
arrays. My program first inserts movies from a text file into a binary search
tree then asks the user for pick one out of 8 available options,find, delete, 
watch, etc.). The program can search, find, delete, and print out movies within
the tree. The array in program is used to keep track of the movies in the
user's inventory and those items can then be returned back into the BST. In
general, my program is just a program to store various items.
