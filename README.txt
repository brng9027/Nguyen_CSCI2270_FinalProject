Project Summary:
This program is just an extension of Assignment 7. It uses both trees and
arrays. My program first inserts items from a text file into a binary search
tree then asks the user for pick one out of 8 available options. The program
can search, find, delete, and print out nodes within the tree. The array in
program is used to keep track of the movies in the user's inventory and those
items can then be returned back into the BST. In general, my program is just
a program to store various items.

How to Run:
Open main.cpp then click run on your c++ driver (Make sure to have the 
Assignment6.txt file). A menu should pop up with 8 options and the user should
choose one of the numbers.

Dependencies:
Assignment6.txt

System Requirements:
